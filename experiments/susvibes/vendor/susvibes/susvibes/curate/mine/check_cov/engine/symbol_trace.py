"""Precise backward symbol trace via jedi.

Subsumes the file-level approximations (direct import, re-export, import-graph
reachability, distinctive-symbol matching) with a single precise question: is
there a real symbol-reference chain from some test into a symbol DEFINED in the
target file?

The trace is a backward BFS over the symbol use-graph. Seeds are the symbols
defined in the target file that can be referenced from outside it and reliably found
by get_references — module-level functions, classes, and globals, plus class methods
(properties included); see ``seed_symbol_positions``. jedi's project-wide
``get_references`` finds every place each symbol is used; ``successors`` maps each
use to the innermost such symbol that carries it, expanded on the next hop:

  - a use inside a test file means the target is reached (covered);
  - a use inside a function/method body taints that function, expanded on the next
    hop — so a wrapper chain of any length is found; a dunder, lacking a by-name
    call site, continues through its CLASS instead;
  - a use directly in a class body (a base class, a class-variable value) taints the
    class — who instantiates or subclasses it is then traced;
  - a use bound into a module-level global (``urlpatterns = [MyView]``) taints that
    global, so a test that uses the global reaches the target. This keeps the trace
    symbol-precise instead of degrading to "the file is importable" the moment a
    symbol is used at module top level;
  - a use at module top level with no name to continue (a bare ``register(X)``)
    has no symbol to follow: the file simply executes it on import, so the only
    signal left is whether a test imports that file (import-graph reachability).
    This narrow backstop applies ONLY to a file where we actually found such a
    top-level reference, so it does not reintroduce blanket file-level matching.

The frontier is FIFO, so hop distance grows monotonically and the FIRST test hit
is the shortest chain — the search returns immediately on that hit. ``seen``
dedup keeps the walk linear; ``max_depth`` bounds how far a chain is followed.

Scope discovery uses parso (the syntax tree), NOT jedi name inference:
``Name.type`` / ``infer`` would spawn jedi's compiled subprocess to resolve
imports, which is not thread-safe and corrupts its pipe under the thread pool.
Only ``get_references`` (a pure reference search) uses jedi.

Runs inside a version-matched cov_py container, so the jedi/parso here are the
ones pinned for the target's Python version (jedi 0.19/parso 0.8 on py3.6+, jedi
0.17/parso 0.7 on py2.7/3.5) — so jedi parses the sources and the trace is the sole
coverage engine (no file-level fallback).
