"""Coverage labels, result shape, and tuning constants for the check_cov engine.

Two parts:
  - DATA SHAPE: the coverage label class, the result dict shape, and the small
    helpers that build results.
  - TUNING: scoring thresholds and per-engine knobs, grouped by owning engine.

py2/py3 dual-compatible (this whole package is vendored into py2.7-3.12 cov_py
containers): the label set is a plain string-constant class, NOT ``enum.StrEnum``
(3.11+, unavailable in older containers). A member still IS its string value
(compare/serialize/dict-key it directly), so the StrEnum contract the rest of the
codebase relies on is preserved — only the declaration differs.
