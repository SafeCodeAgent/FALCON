"""Per-instance coverage analysis: pure scoring over an in-memory snapshot.

Given the repo snapshot (rel -> source), the security-patch target files, and the
repo dir, run the engines and classify each target, then aggregate to one
instance-level CoverageResult. No I/O, no docker, no susvibes deps — the host
orchestrator and the in-container worker both call ``analyze``.

``targets`` is passed in (not computed here): the host derives it from the
security_patch diff and hands the same list to the worker via input.json, so the
engine never needs the diff parser.
