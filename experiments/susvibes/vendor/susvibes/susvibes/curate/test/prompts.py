What "dynamic security tests" means here:
- The tests MUST execute the relevant code paths.

- Avoid static analyzers / linters as the primary signal.

The repo's existing functional tests (NOT what you're writing) are launched

You do NOT need to run these tests. You only need this so your sectests.sh
uses the SAME Python environment they do with dependencies. If the command
activates a virtualenv (e.g. `. /path/.venv/bin/activate`) or uses an
absolute interpreter path (e.g. `/tmp/tests/bin/pytest`), put the equivalent
activation at the top of sectests.sh. Otherwise, no extra step needed.
