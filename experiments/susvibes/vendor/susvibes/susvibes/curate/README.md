# SusVibes Curation

This directory is a vendored snapshot of the SusVibes task-curation pipeline: mining vulnerability records, identifying each repo's developer tools, checking test coverage, adaptively generating task candidates, building per-instance Docker environments, and execution-based validation. The FALCON benchmark uses the public task dataset and the separate `falcon-susvibes` inference and grading commands documented in the repository root. These curation instructions are retained as source reference.

The pipeline runs in this order (all artifacts land under `datasets/<run_id>/` and `env_specs/<run_id>/`):

1. [`mine/process`](mine/) — mine vulnerability-fixing commits → `processed_dataset.jsonl`
2. [`env_setup/dev_tools`](env_setup/) — identify each repo's Python version → `dev_tools.json`
3. [`env_setup/build_base`](env_setup/) `--mode pull` — pull the `base_py` / `dind_py` / `cov_py` images for those versions
4. [`mine/check_cov`](mine/check_cov/) — label each instance's test coverage → `coverage_report.jsonl`
5. [`adaptive_gen`](adaptive_gen/) — generate masks + problem statements for the covered instances → `task_dataset.jsonl`
6. [`env_setup/build_repo`](env_setup/) — build a per-instance environment image → `env_dataset.jsonl`
7. [`validate`](validate/) — validate via execution, then publish the dataset

Several stages drive SWE-agent. Install it from source per its [guidelines](https://swe-agent.com/latest/installation/source/) (a `conda` env is recommended); for each agent stage, place its config (named below) under SWE-agent's `config/` directory and configure its setting under [`utils/agents/settings/`](utils/agents/settings/) (pre-filled examples are provided). Run the agent batches as specified in [`utils/agents/runs.sh`](utils/agents/runs.sh).

## 1. Collecting Vulnerability Records

Retrieve data on historically observed software vulnerabilities from existing datasets. We provide the ReposVul dataset as an example; download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vk_WAPW3DvRsRKT7mfb4lpZWtVEGED0M/view?usp=share_link) and place it at `datasets/cve_records/ReposVul/`. Then run:

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.mine.process \
    --max_records 3 \
    --use_handlers '["ReposVulHandler"]' \
    --run_id playground
```

This produces `processed_dataset.jsonl` — an assembled dataset of vulnerability-fixing commits.

## 2. Identifying Developer Tools

An agent identifies the Python version each project requires and maps it to an available base-image version, producing `env_specs/<run_id>/dev_tools.json` (see [`env_specs/default/dev_tools.json`](../env_specs/default/dev_tools.json) for an example). It reads `processed_dataset.jsonl` (SWE-agent config: [`utils/agents/configs/curate.yaml`](utils/agents/configs/curate.yaml)):

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.env_setup.dev_tools \
  --run_id playground
```

## 3. Pulling Base Images

Pull the per-version `base_py`, `dind_py`, and `cov_py` images from the registry configured by `SUSVIBES_IMAGE_NAMESPACE` for the Python versions `dev_tools` identified — `check_cov` and `build_repo` expect them present locally:

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.env_setup.build_base \
  --mode pull \
  --image_names '["base_py", "dind_py", "cov_py"]' \
  --versions '["3.10", "3.11"]'
```

## 4. Checking Test Coverage

For each instance, statically decide (no execution) whether the repo's own test suite covers the files touched by the security fix, inside a version-matched `cov_py` container. This labels each instance (`likely_covered` / `maybe_covered` / `unlikely_covered` / `unknown`) and writes `coverage_report.jsonl`; only `likely_covered` / `maybe_covered` instances proceed to the next step. See [`mine/check_cov/`](mine/check_cov/) for details.

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.mine.check_cov \
  --run_id playground \
  --max_workers 5
```

## 5. Generating Task Candidates

From the covered vulnerability-fixing commits, an adaptive pipeline creates a SusVibes task for each:

1. **An agent generates an initial mask** on the vulnerable commit (before the security fix), masking out a software feature from its vulnerable implementation.
2. **A task description is generated** for the masked implementation.
3. **A verifier agent** checks whether the description covers all lines of the security-fixed feature implementation; if not, it retries the mask.

These stages are implemented in [`adaptive_gen/core.py`](adaptive_gen/core.py) (SWE-agent config: [`utils/agents/configs/curate.yaml`](utils/agents/configs/curate.yaml)). They run only on the instances `check_cov` labeled covered, and save tasks to `task_dataset.jsonl` (previewed at `datasets/<run_id>/examples/`):

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.adaptive_gen.core \
  --max_iters <num_adaptive_iterations> \
  --preview 2 \
  --run_id playground
```

## 6. Building Execution Environments

Build a Docker image for each task capable of executing the test suite of its repository, using the environment-building SWE-agent configuration in [`utils/agents/configs/env_setup.yaml`](utils/agents/configs/env_setup.yaml). The agent starts inside the corresponding base image and consults the pre-existing container configuration, CI/CD pipeline, and other docs to reproduce the testing workflow, then bakes the working install + test steps into a new image.

First, prepare the agent run:

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.env_setup.build_repo \
  --prologue \
  --run_id playground
```

Then run the environment-building agent as specified in [`utils/agents/runs.sh`](utils/agents/runs.sh).

> **Note:** *This step can be resource-consuming in time and space, as the agent repeatedly installs dependencies, tests the environment, and builds Docker images. We recommend at least 2GB of free storage per instance and adjusting parallelism to available CPU cores.*

After the agent finishes, build the environment images from its output, producing `env_dataset.jsonl` (each record tagged with its `env_image_name`):

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.env_setup.build_repo \
  --epilogue \
  --agent_output_dir <path_to_agent_output> \
  --max_workers 5 \
  --run_id playground \
  [--from_existing_dockerfiles]  # Optional: reuse the cached dockerfile in env_specs instead of re-extracting it from agent output
```

## 7. Validating and Publishing

Validation synthesizes test-suite output parsers and verifies each task instance against its environment (expected security + functional test breaks), tagging an evaluation image per validated instance:

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.validate.with_test \
  --max_workers 5 \
  --run_id playground \
  [--force]                # Optional: force re-validation
  [--from_existing_specs]  # Optional: reuse the cached logs_parser in env_specs instead of re-synthesizing it via LLM
```

This requires an LLM API for generating test-suite output parsers: configure the model in [`constants.py`](constants.py), set the API key in your `.env`, and set your Docker Hub namespace in [`susvibes/core/constants.py`](../core/constants.py).

If you want to publish the dataset, finalize it and publish to it Hugging Face:

```bash
python -m susvibes.curate.validate.wrap_up \
  --run_id playground
```

This filters to validated instances, computes each golden patch, strips records to the released schema, and writes the result to `datasets/<run_id>/susvibes_dataset.jsonl` — the final dataset the evaluation harness consumes. Pass `--push_to_hub` to also upload it to the Hugging Face dataset repo set by `HF_DATASET_REPO` in [`susvibes/core/constants.py`](../core/constants.py) (set `HF_TOKEN` with write access in your `.env` first).

## Two Curation Pipelines

The seven steps above are the **main pipeline**: each task's security `test_patch` is mined directly from the vulnerability-fixing commit. A **second pipeline** handles commits that ship *no* test changes — there's no potential tests that come with the security-fix commit, so a SWE-agent synthesizes the security tests from the security fix, while functional regression still uses the repo's own suite.

The second pipeline reuses the same stages, differing only in three points:

- Steps 1, 5, 6 (`mine.process`, `adaptive_gen.core`, `build_repo --prologue`) take `--require_test false` — keeping only the test-less records; steps 2–4 are unchanged.
- A test-synthesis stage is inserted before validation: `test.gen_prologue` drives a SWE-agent to author the security tests.
- Step 7 validation uses `validate.no_test` instead of `validate.with_test`; `wrap_up` is shared.

See [`test`](test/) for the full second-pipeline walkthrough (it also covers manually editing an existing `test_patch`).
